    Vyper allows you to use unit label to either <code>uint256</code>, <code>int128</code>, or <code>decimal</code> type. This feature is implemented to increase code readability and security. However, <code>as_unitless_number()</code> function is used in the contract. Use of this function can endanger contract security.

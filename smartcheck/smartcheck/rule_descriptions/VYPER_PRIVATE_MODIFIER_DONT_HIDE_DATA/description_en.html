    Initializing the variables without the <code>public</code> function defaults to a private declaration and thus only accessible to methods within the same contract. Contrary to a popular misconception, values of these variables are still accessible for users. Developers must account for the lack of privacy in Ethereum. 
    This rule reports all structure's fields in structure definition but it is not the issue (it is false positive).

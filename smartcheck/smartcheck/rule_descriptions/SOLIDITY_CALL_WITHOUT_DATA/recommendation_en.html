    In this case, <code>transfer</code> or <code>send</code> function call is more secure. Another option is to implement the desired functionality in the separate public function of the target contract. Nevertheless, if use of <code>call</code> function is necessary due to the target contract design, gas limit should be added (<code>.gas()</code>).

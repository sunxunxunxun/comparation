Functions of ERC-20 Token Standard should throw in special cases:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>transfer</code> should throw if the <code>_from</code> account balance does not have enough tokens to spend</li>
    <li><code>transferFrom</code> should throw unless the <code>_from</code> account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism</li>
</ul>

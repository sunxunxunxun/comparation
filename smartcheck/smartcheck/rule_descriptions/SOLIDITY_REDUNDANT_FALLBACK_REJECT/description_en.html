<p>
    The payment rejection fallback is redundant.
</p>
<p>
    Contracts should reject unexpected payments. Before Solidity 0.4.0, it was done manually:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
function () { revert(); }
</code>
</pre>
<p>
Starting from Solidity 0.4.0, contracts without a fallback function automatically
revert payments, making the code above redundant.

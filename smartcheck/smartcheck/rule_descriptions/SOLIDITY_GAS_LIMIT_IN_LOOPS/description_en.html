    Ethereum is a very resource-constrained environment. Prices per computational step are orders of magnitude higher than with centralized providers. Moreover, Ethereum miners impose a limit on the total number of gas consumed in a block. If <code>array.length</code> is large enough, the function exceeds the block gas limit, and transactions calling it will never be confirmed:
</p>
<pre><code>
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < array.length ; i++) {
        cosltyFunc();
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
    This becomes a security issue, if an external actor influences <code>array.length</code>.
    E.g., if array enumerates all registered addresses, an adversary can register many addresses, causing the problem described above.
